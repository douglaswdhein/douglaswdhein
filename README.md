Hello! I'm Douglas, a professional working as a real estate broker, but also venturing into the world of development, an area that has always piqued my interest.

I have a technical background in computer science and I am a full stack developer. Recently, I completed a degree in real estate transactions, further expanding my expertise in the real estate market.

I'm passionate about technology, and I believe that the combination of this passion with my proactive, dedicated, and hardworking nature allows me to explore various professional fields with diligence.

As a real estate broker, I am accustomed to dealing with challenges and seeking efficient solutions for my clients' needs. My development experience provides me with a creative and innovative approach to finding technological solutions.

I am always seeking learning and improvement, striving to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies. I have developed communication skills, which allow me to interact effectively with clients, colleagues, and multidisciplinary teams.
