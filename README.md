I’m a professional working as a real estate broker, but I also venture into the world of development, an area that has always sparked my interest and that I intend to rejoin. 

I have a technical background in IT from the Instituto Ivoti and I’m a certified full stack developer from the Starter Program by Growdev, a startup with the purpose of training new developers. 

In this program, I had the opportunity to learn everything from basic to advanced concepts of each technology used. Recently, I completed a degree in real estate transactions, further expanding my expertise in the real estate market, and I’m currently pursuing a degree in analysis and systems development at Unisinos university, with the aim of further expanding my knowledge in the world of technology.
